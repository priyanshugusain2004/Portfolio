# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi, I'm Priyanshu Gusain. This is my personal portfolio—a place where I share my projects, skills, and a bit about my journey as a developer. I built this site with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and I hope it inspires you or helps us connect!

## ✨ Features
- Eye-catching hero section
- Projects showcase with details

- Fully responsive and modern design

## 🌍 Deploy Your Own

### Deploy to Vercel (Super Easy)
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), import your repo, and deploy.
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite and does the rest.

Other options: Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static host.
